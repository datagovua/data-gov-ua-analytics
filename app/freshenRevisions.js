/*
* Freshen revisions using the following algorithm:
* 1. Match nodes to files using file_url, fill in dataset_revision_id to nodes
* 2. Get nodes with content type resource where dataset_revision_id is not set
* 3. Get organization_id for those nodes
* 4. Identify files of all datasets of these organizations
* 5. Match identified files to file nodes using file_title (group by url)
* 6. Generate dataset ids for matches
* 7. Freshen temp_revisions (force fetch unless revisions is already known), fetch revisions metadata
